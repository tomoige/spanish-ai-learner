export const quizPrompt = `Please provide a list of 20 random (attempt to make it as random as possible) Spanish words from the top 5000 most commonly used words in Spanish. Each word should be in the following format:

{
  "word": "spanish_word",
  "translations": ["translation_1", "translation_2"],
  "type": "word_type"
}


If the word has only one translation, the \`translations\` field should still be an array with a single value. All words should be lowercase for easy parsing. The \`type\` should match one of the following categories:

- Noun
- Pronoun
- Verb
- Adjective
- Adverb
- Preposition
- Conjunction
- Interjection
- Article

For example:

[
  {
    "word": "gente",
    "translations": ["people"],
    "type": "noun"
  },
  {
    "word": "claro",
    "translations": ["clear", "of course"],
    "type": "adjective"
  }
] 

This format is required to create a quiz for my Spanish learning website where users will translate these words and receive a score at the end. You must only respond with the list and nothing else, therefore it is easier for me to format.`;
